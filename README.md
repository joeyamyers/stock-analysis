# stock-analysis

## Overview
### Purpose:
The original goal of undertaking this analysis is to help Steve's parents make an informed investment decision regarding tweleve different green energy stocks. I used stock performance data from 2017 and 2018 to accomplish the analysis and provided Steve a workbook to analyze a dataset at a click of a button. After successfully performing this analysis for Steve, he wants to expand the dataset and to refactor the original code in order to improve the performance for future stock analyses. Refactoring the code will not change the the content of the code, but only improve its performance.

## Results
### Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring code can be likened to proofreading an essay to make it more clear and concise. It does not change the funcitionality or purpose of the original script, however the advantages come from making the code more efficient. Making code more efficient can mean several things like making the code easier to read for other users through improving the logic of the code and taking fewer steps and also by using less memory.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
